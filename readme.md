# Bunnicula-Playground

#### a little project to play with [Bunnicula](https://github.com/nomnom-insights/nomnom.bunnicula) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)

This project was designed for [REPL-Driven Development](https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction) so it is recommended you work in your editor-of-choice
and use the "evaluate in REPL" functionality of that tool

## Setup

1. install RabbitMQ on your development system
   - MacOS - suggest using ["How to install RabbitMQ on Mac using Homebrew"](https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-rabbitmq-on-mac-using-homebrew)
   - Windows - ["Installing RabbitMQ On Windows Using Scoop"](https://www.kongsli.net/2015/10/05/installing-rabbitmq-on-windows-using-scoop/)
2. Start up Editor/IDE
3. Start a REPL
4. Evaluate code
